    abstract = {A population of free-floating planets is known from
                gravitational microlensing surveys. None have a directly measured
                mass, owing to a degeneracy with the distance, but the population
                statistics indicate that many are less massive than Jupiter. We
                report a microlensing event—KMT-2024-BLG-0792/OGLE-2024-BLG-0516,
                which was observed from both ground- and space-based
                telescopes—that breaks the mass-distance degeneracy. The event
                was caused by an object with 0.219−0.046+0.075 Jupiter masses
                that is either gravitationally unbound or on a very wide orbit.
                Through comparison with the statistical properties of other
                observed microlensing events and predictions from simulations, we
                infer that this object likely formed in a protoplanetary disk
                (like a planet), not in isolation (like a brown dwarf). Dynamical
                processes then ejected it from its birthplace, producing a
                free-floating object. Gravitational microlensing causes the
                apparent brightness of a background star to vary when a
                foreground object passes across our line of sight. The mass and
                distance of the lensing object are usually degenerate parameters.
                Dong et al. have identified a microlensing event caused by a
                planetary-mass object with no associated host star (see the
                Perspective by Coleman). By combining observations from Earth and
                a distant spacecraft, the mass-distance degeneracy can be broken,
                allowing for measurement of the lensing object’s mass, which is
                similar to Saturn’s. The researchers argue that this
                free-floating object did not form in isolation but was ejected
                from a host planetary system by dynamical interactions.},
